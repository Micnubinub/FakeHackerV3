## Fake hacker

An android app that allows you to carry out actions based on the state of you device.

**It takes in:**
-Battery (level / charging state / temperature)
-App launch


*Note it used to work, but with the new versions of android settings and certain data has been getting more and more restricted to protect people from apps that abuse their access. App is mostly useless on the latest version of android, but if you have an old device you can run it there*
